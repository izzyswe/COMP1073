        /* ORâ€¦ num1 * num2 / 8 + 2 - 0.5; */

        /* Keep in mind operator precedence, just like you were taught in math class (/, *, +, -)

        ++ and -- are mostly found inside loops to move a counter variable to the next value when needed, either up or down. */

        // Note 1 - you cannot increment/decrement a number directly
        // Note 2 - typing num++ or num-- in the console will output the number before incrementing or decrmenting - try ++num or --num, instead

        ===	(strict equality), !==	(strict-non-equality), == (equality), < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or equal to), >=	(greater than or equal to) */
        let step5a = 5;
        let step5b = "5";
        let step5c = step5a === step5b; //=== will STRICTLY tell whethere they are both same datatype and content value
        output.textContent = step5c;
